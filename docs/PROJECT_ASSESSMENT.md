```

**Architectural Highlights:**
- **Interface-Based Design**: Platform interface enables polymorphic behavior
- **Domain Separation**: Clear boundaries between physics, models, and presentation
- **Dependency Direction**: Proper inward dependency flow
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new platform types and behaviors

### 1.2 Code Quality Assessment

**Physics Engine** (`internal/sim/physics.go`):
- Advanced 3D physics implementation with realistic constraints
- Platform-specific force calculations (aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, orbital)
- Sophisticated integration methods for position and velocity updates

**Universal Platform System** (`internal/models/`):
- Excellent abstraction supporting aircraft, ships, vehicles, and satellites
- Comprehensive testing with realistic platform factories
- Well-defined interfaces promoting extensibility

**Configuration Management** (`internal/config/`):
- YAML-based configuration with strong validation
- Factory pattern for platform creation
- Scenario-based simulation setup

### 1.3 Performance Considerations

The architecture is explicitly designed for high-performance simulation:
- In-memory state management for low-latency updates
- Goroutine-based concurrency for parallel platform processing
- Spatial indexing and viewport culling for rendering optimization
- Canvas-based rendering avoiding DOM manipulation overhead

## 2. Test Coverage Analysis

### 2.1 Current State: ⭐⭐⭐ (Good, but incomplete)

**Coverage by Module:**
```
internal/models/     50.3%  ✅ Good coverage with comprehensive tests
internal/sim/         0.0%  ❌ Critical gap - physics engine untested
internal/server/      0.0%  ❌ Web server endpoints untested
internal/config/      0.0%  ❌ Configuration loading untested
cmd/simrunner/       FAIL   ❌ Missing dependencies prevent testing
```

### 2.2 Test Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- **Comprehensive Model Testing**: Excellent coverage of platform creation and behavior
- **Physics Integration Tests**: Realistic scenario testing with proper assertions
- **Benchmark Tests**: Performance validation for critical operations
- **Interface Compliance**: Ensures all platforms implement required interfaces

**Test Examples Found:**
```go
// Excellent platform factory testing
func TestPlatformFactory_Boeing737(t *testing.T)
func TestPlatformFactory_M1A2Abrams(t *testing.T)
func TestUniversalPlatform_Update(t *testing.T)

// Physics validation
func TestAerodynamicForceCalculation(t *testing.T)
func TestPositionUpdate(t *testing.T)
```

### 2.3 Critical Testing Gaps

1. **Physics Engine**: No tests for core simulation logic
2. **Web Server**: API endpoints and WebSocket communication untested
3. **Configuration**: YAML parsing and validation untested
4. **Integration**: End-to-end simulation flows untested
5. **Error Handling**: Limited testing of failure scenarios

## 3. Web Frontend Assessment

### 3.1 Current Implementation: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Exceptional for Use Case)

**Architecture Decision: Vanilla JavaScript + Leaflet.js**

This is an **excellent architectural choice** for the specific requirements:

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Canvas-based rendering for 50,000+ entities
- Spatial indexing and viewport culling
- WebGL acceleration for complex visualizations
- Marker clustering for dense datasets
- Direct manipulation of rendering pipeline

**Sophisticated Features:**
```javascript
// High-performance platform renderer
class PlatformRenderer {
    // Optimized for 50,000+ dynamic objects
    constructor(mapEngine) {
        this.useCanvas = true;
        this.clusteringEnabled = false;
        this.spatialIndexing = true;
        this.viewportCulling = true;
    }
}
```

### 3.2 React Migration Assessment: ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED

**Why React Would Be Counterproductive:**

1. **Performance Overhead**: Virtual DOM adds unnecessary abstraction for direct canvas manipulation
2. **Real-time Requirements**: React's component lifecycle conflicts with 60 FPS rendering needs
3. **Specialized Use Case**: Mapping/simulation interfaces benefit from direct hardware access
4. **Current Quality**: Existing implementation is already well-structured and maintainable
5. **Complexity**: React would require build tooling and increase bundle size

**Current Implementation Advantages:**
- **Direct Performance Control**: No framework overhead
- **Optimized for Use Case**: Purpose-built for high-performance mapping
- **Simple Deployment**: No build step required
- **Debugging Simplicity**: Direct browser debugging without source maps

### 3.3 Frontend Modernization Recommendations

Instead of React, consider these targeted improvements:

1. **TypeScript Migration**: Add type safety while maintaining performance
2. **ES6 Modules**: Better organization without framework overhead
3. **Web Workers**: Offload computation from main thread
4. **Service Workers**: Offline capability and caching
5. **Modern Build Tools**: Vite or Rollup for optimization

## 4. Dependency and Build Issues

### 4.1 Critical Issues Blocking Development

**Missing Dependencies in go.mod:**
```bash
# Required packages not in go.mod
github.com/gorilla/mux        # HTTP routing
github.com/gorilla/websocket  # WebSocket support
```

**Immediate Fix Required:**
```bash
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
```

### 4.2 Development Environment

**Current Tools:**
- Comprehensive Makefile with proper targets
- VS Code tasks for development workflow
- Docker support for containerized deployment
- golangci-lint integration for code quality

## 5. Performance Analysis
